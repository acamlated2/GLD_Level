# GLD_Level
Game Level Design level submission

All assets are my own creation except everything inside the folder "StarterContent" which is Unreal's starter content assets, and Unreal's third person game template assets such as the third person character. 


The university can use everything in this submission for teaching and promotional materials

If the submission cannot be opened, the same project can be seen from my GitHub:
